2023: Version 3.0.0

   - Samplerate is in Hz instead of 10 Hz.
   - Fixed problem that magnitude and phase commands could not be run on time
     domain signals.
   - Fixed histogram plot, wrong values at x-axis.

Dec 17 2022: Version 2.0.1

   - Fixed inverse fft.

Dec 3 2022: Version 2.0.0

   ASM Java version is now more or less in the same state as the
   original C version on RISC-OS, with the addition of menus and
   dialogs for most of the commands and several bugs fixed.

   - Signal window has a tool bar with zoom buttons, and a combo box
     to set the view mode.
   - Signal window has scroll bars.
   - Zoom-in is limited to avoid rendering issues.
   - Text area of Console windows grows with window in vertical direction.
   - All commands give a short help text if you give argument ? or -h.
   - Documented commands 'copy' and 'rename'.
   - Added command 'signaldir' to set directory where to open and save signals.
   - Fixed reading magnitude/phase/histogram signals from file.


Oct 21 2022: Version 2.0.0-alpha1

   - Rewrote ASM in Java using JavaFX graphics.
   - Each signal is shown in its own window.
   - Menus and dialogs for most of the commands.
   - Fixed bode magnitude plot for very low values. Plot is cut at -100 dB.


Jul 1 2022: Version 1.1.3

   In 2021 I started porting ASM to Java + JavaFX to make a good interface.
   During this work I found a some bugs which are fixed in this version.

   This is the last C based version. Development will go on in the Java
   version.


   - Fixed high CPU load when waiting for input.
   - Fixed wrong values at Y-axis when the maximum value was smaller than
     the absolute minimal value.
   - Fixed Blackman, Hamming, Hanning, and Kaiser windows.
   - Added missing command for window Block.
   - Fixed shift function for signals with more than one record.
   - Fixed rotate function for negative rotation.
   - Fixed command description of correlation and convolution in the manual.
   - Updated doc/makefile for PDF generation from LaTeX.
   - Removed the PostScript documentation file.
   - The default sample rate is 10240 Hz.
   - The default screen resolution is 1024x768.

   The following keyboard shortcuts have been added (The Escape key and
   several function keys of my laptop are broken :) ).

   - ALT-X and CTRL-C bring you to the title screen.
   - SHIFT-<Left> and SHIFT-<Right> show the previous and next signal.
   - CTRL-<Left> and CTRL-<Right> to zoom out and in.

   Removed the DOS and Linux binaries.
   The Windows binary has been built with MinGW-w64 gcc 4.9.2 (i686-w64-mingw32)
   and Allegro 4.4.2. I was not able to build Allegro 4.4.2 myself anymore. I took
   the Allegro 4.4.2 binary package for MinGW 4.5.2 from https://www.allegro.cc/


Jul 28 2015: Version 1.1.2

   I did not look at ASM for a long time. I noticed the Windows compiled
   program does not run on Windows 8, so I recompiled it with newer tools.

   - Fixed slow printing of text on Windows.
   - Keys <Left> and <Right> now scroll the displayed signal left and right.
   - Removed i586 (Pentium) target from makefiles.
   - Use MinGW-w64 32 bit compiler from the MSYS2 project.
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2
     Using gcc 4.9.2, Target: i686-w64-mingw32
   - Use Allegro 4.4.2 library.
     MSYS2 already includes DirectX. No need to use dx70_mgw.zip.
     To build Allegro with MSYS2 do:

        mkdir Build; cd Build
        cmake \
        -G "MSYS Makefiles" \
        -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH:PATH=/mingw32/i686-w64-mingw32/ \
        ..
        make ; make install


   If I had more time I would make a good
   interface using the QT library.


Sep 8 2007: Version 1.1.1

   - Updated documentation, chapter Introduction.


Jun 27 2007: version 1.1

   - Use Allegro 4.2.1 library.
   - Fix buffer overflow, in signal name.
   - Signal image can be saved in BMP format.
   - Target Pentium processor.
   - Build new Windows and Linux version.
   - Rebuild DOS version.
   - Updated documentation.
   - The following compilers have been used:
     DOS    : DJGPP 2.03, gcc 3.4.4
     Windows: MinGW 4.1, gcc 3.4.2
     Linux  : Red Hat Linux 9.0, gcc 3.2.2


Oct 8 1998: Version 1.0

   - Retyped the documentation in a condensed version in LaTeX.
     The original documentation was written on an Acorn Archimedes
     computer, in Dutch. I have only a paper copy.
     Added PostScript and PDF documents.

Aug 25 1997

   - Caluculation functons copy the HScale factor of the source
     signal to the target signal.

Aug 20 1997

   - readwav command added.

Aug 19 1997

   - Command and poll prompt added.

Aug 11 1997

   - recompiled Allegro library.
     FIX_SHIFT define in file misc.s set 16.

Jul 18 1997

   - Function XscaleCi in plotcomm.c
     1. Build in check for scalefactor, may not be zero. This
        can happen if you type by accident e.g. xscale 0,5
        in stead of xscale 0.5
   - Function LnCi and LogCi in calculat.c
     1. check if the signal has values that are negative or zero.

Jul 17 1997

   - Function BitmapCi in commnd1.c
     1. Function saved image always in PCX format.
     2. It's possible to save only in PCX and TGA format,
        not BMP.
   - Function Dossshell in commnd1.c
     1. Function always called "command.com" as the dos-shell.
        Now is calls wat the COMSPEC environment variable is.

Jul 16 1997: Version 1.0 beta.

   First version of ASM for DOS.
   Used DJGPP (gcc 2.7.2) and Allegro graphical library (version 2.2).

1993

   Initial version on Acorn Archimedes RISC-OS.
